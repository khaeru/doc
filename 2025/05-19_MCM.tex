\section{Whence and why \texttt{genno}?}

\subsection{Origin story, design goals, and outcomes}

\begin{frame}<1>[label=origin-story]
\frametitle{Origin story}

\structure{‘Reporting’} is to take the ‘raw’ model solution
and produce things of interest: derived data, tables, figures, etc.
\begin{itemize}
  \item In other words: \emph{everything} that happens after the GAMS/CPLEX optimizer
    finds optimal values for MESSAGE variables like \texttt{CAP}, \texttt{ACT}, etc.
\end{itemize}

\pause
\medskip
We have (and still use) some reporting code developed during a 2018 ‘hackathon’.
In 2019 we identified some issues with this code, chiefly:

\begin{description}
  \item [Complexity] the code is on the order of 5000–10000 lines,
    bigger than the model ‘core’ and the code used to set up the model.
  \item [Performance] the code can take longer to run than the optimizer itself.
\end{description}

\medskip
We set out to address these issues.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[plain]

\againframe<2>{origin-story}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Outline}

\tableofcontents

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]
\frametitle{Design goals}
We had many of these, but most importantly:

\bigskip
\structure{\bfseries Build on upstream packages} with high quality and performance.

\begin{description}
  \item [Performance] \mod{numpy}, \mod{pandas}, and others have good support for vectorized operations,
    and are regularly used for data \emph{much larger} than what goes in to/out of MESSAGE.
  \item [Quality] Many of these projects have full-time developers and maintainers.
    This makes them stable, relatively bug-free, well-documented, etc.
\end{description}

Make \emph{full use} of their features instead of duplicating them.

Provide only \emph{thin wrappers} and \emph{conveniences} that are easily maintained.

\framebreak
\structure{\bfseries Automate} repetitive tasks.

\begin{description}
  \item [High-level] common operations that one ‘nearly always' wants to do
    when working with MESSAGE data. (Examples to come.)
  \item [Low-level] handle dimensionality, sparsity of our data.
    Handle unit alignment, conversion, and derivation.
\end{description}

In both cases, make it easy to do the “right” (correct and performant) thing.
\emph{Reduce} cases where modelers have to duplicate or re-write the same operations →
fewer chances for fragile or slow code.

\medskip

\structure{\bfseries Reduce workload} for developers and maintainers%
—especially in iterative model-building workflows that lead to tweaking and revising methods:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Make complex methods more easily traceable.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Design outcomes}
This led to a core set of capabilities that we packaged as \mod{genno}.

The name (“hammer” in Japanese) is a reference to the saying:

\begin{quote}
  “When you have a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.”
\end{quote}

…which can remind us of George Box's famous saying:
\begin{quote}
  “All models are wrong, but some are useful.”
\end{quote}

\begin{itemize}
  \item It turns out these affordances (features) are also very useful
    for \structure{pre-}processing: dealing with the data that go \emph{in} to the core model.
  \item Thus, for instance, the model-build process for MESSAGEix-Transport
    is structured as a set of genno operations.

    This has given us flexibility to make workflow changes required for many ongoing projects.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Basic concepts: chained operations — task graphs — quantities}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Basic concepts: chained operations}
If you've used \mod{pandas},
you will have seen code like this:
(\href{https://github.com/iiasa/message-ix-models/blob/7a999bc0c636f0afea73f89f12e5cfe593d6d23c/message_ix_models/tools/iamc.py#L240-L254}
{from \mod{message_ix_models}})

\begin{columns}
\column{0.45\paperwidth}
\begin{minted}{python}
data.drop(columns=drop or [])
.query(query)
.replace(replace or {})
.dropna(how="all", axis=1)
.rename(columns=lambda c: c.upper())
.pipe(_raise_empty, query=query)
.pipe(_drop_unique, columns=unique, ...)
.pipe(_assign_n, missing=non_iso_3166)
.dropna(subset=["n"])
.drop("REGION", axis=1)
.set_index(set_index)
.rename(columns=lambda y: int(y))
.rename_axis(columns="y")
.stack()
.dropna()
\end{minted}

\column{0.45\paperwidth}
\pause
This pattern is called \structure{\bfseries chained operations}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Each method call (like \py{.rename()}) \emph{acts on}
    the data structure: usually a \py{pandas.DataFrame} from the previous step.
  \item Each call \emph{returns} a modified frame that is input to the next step/operation, etc.
\end{itemize}

This code \emph{can be} compact and performant.
\end{columns}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Challenges and pitfalls in using plain \texttt{pandas}}

Some issues we noted with our ‘legacy' reporting code:

\bigskip
\begin{itemize}
  \item Using \mod{pandas} chaining effectively takes \structure{careful coding}.

    It's too easy to fall back to e.g. nested loops → very slow code.
  \item It's not simple to:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \structure{reuse an intermediate product} from a chain%
        —branch and carry on 2+ further chains without having to recompute.
      \item \structure{trace and step-through} intermediate steps in a long chain.
    \end{itemize}
  \item It's challenging to deal with \structure{operations involving multi-dimensional quantities}.

    For MESSAGE, we have to handle e.g. the
    \texttt{input} parameter (10-D),
    \texttt{ACT} variable (6-D), etc.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]
\frametitle{Basic concepts: task graphs (\texttt{dask})}
The core logic of \mod{genno} relies on a package named \mod{dask}.

\medskip
Dask is built and used for truly \structure{‘Big’ Data}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Imagine you have data spread across 10s or 100s of machines
    and want to do some operation on it—say, compute an average.
  \item Break this task into smaller tasks:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item On each machine: load the local data,
        compute its average \emph{and} number of data points.
      \item Return these intermediate values to a 'master' machine/process.
      \item Aggregate the sub-averages to an overall average.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\framebreak

\begin{columns}
\column{0.45\paperwidth}
In order to prepare and execute this kind of algorithm,
the atomic tasks can be represented as a mathematical \structure{\bfseries graph}
of \structure{nodes} (operations/tasks)
and \structure{edges} (data that's output from one task/input to the next).

\medskip
This nodes-and-edges paradigm is also useful on a single machine.

\medskip
\mod{genno} uses \mod{dask}'s performant features for executing graphs of calculations.
\mod{genno} adds many conveniences to make it easy to assemble these graphs.

\column{0.45\paperwidth}
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Directed_acyclic_graph_2.pdf}
\end{columns}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks,fragile]
\frametitle{Quantities (\texttt{xarray}, \texttt{pandas}, and \texttt{pint})}

\mod{xarray} another high-quality package that provides data structures like \py{xr.DataArray}
for \structure{labeled N-dimensional data}.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Example: climate data with dimensions (latitude, longitude, elevation, time)
    for multiple measures like temperature (°C) and pressure (kPa).
  \item Contrast with:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \mod{numpy}: N-dimensional, but no text labels.
      \item \mod{pandas}: text labels, but first-class support only for 2-D (row, column) data.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\medskip
\mod{genno} provides a \py{Quantity} class that:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Has the same interface as \py{xarray.DataArray}.
  \item Handles large, 'sparse' data—using \mod{pandas} internally for performance.
  \item Carries and handles units for entire quantities—using \mod{pint}.
\end{itemize}

\framebreak
\begin{minted}{python-console}
>>> from genno import Quantity as Q
>>> days = {"day": ["Mon", "Tue"]}               # Dimension ID & labels
>>> q1 = Q([1.0, 2.0], units="km", coords=days)  # 1-D quantity
>>> q2 = Q(1.0, units="mile")                    # 0-D quantity
>>> q1 + q2                     # Alignment and compatible units handled
day
Mon    2.609344
Tue    3.609344
dtype: float64, units: kilometer

>>> q3 = Q([10., 8.], units="km/h", coords=days)
>>> q1 / q3                                       # Units are derived
day
Mon    0.10
Tue    0.25
dtype: float64, units: hour
\end{minted}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Operation and operators}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Operations and operators}

Following \mod{dask}, in \mod{genno} an ‘operator’ is \structure{any Python function or callable}.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Can be simple (“Compute $f(x,y) = x^y$”) or complex (“Compute the logit share weight algorithm of Kyle et al. (2010)”).
  \item Any number of inputs that can be N-dimensional quantities or other types.
  \item Can output Quantity or anything else.
\end{itemize}

\medskip
A growing library → pick-and-reuse instead of writing new code:
\begin{description}
  \item [\ttfamily genno] 42 operators%
    —basic arithmetic,
    manipulate dimensions, labels, and units,
    compatibility with SDMX and IAMC data structures.
  \item [\ttfamily ixmp] 7 operators%
    —retrieve/store Scenarios, time-series–, and model data
  \item [\ttfamily message\_ix] 4 operators%
    —construct and handle data for MESSAGE parameters.
  \item [\ttfamily message-ix-models] 20 general operators + 53 for MESSAGEix-Transport.
\end{description}
\end{frame}

\section{Reporting / post-processing}

\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]
\frametitle{Reporting: some example requirements}
From a long list collected in 2019:

\medskip
We want to \structure{\bfseries compute the product} of:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textt{input}—a MESSAGE parameter with 10 dimensions
    that we can write as \texttt{nl-t-yv-ya-m-no-c-l-h-ho}.
  \item \texttt{ACT:nl-t-yv-ya-m-h}—a 6-D (solution) variable, dimensions overlap with \texttt{input}.
\end{itemize}
→ Call this product \texttt{in:nl-t-yv-ya-m-no-c-l-h-ho = (input:*) × (ACT:*)}.
\begin{itemize}
  \item For some calculations, we'll want to use \emph{all the dimensions}
  \item For others, we may want to sum/average over \emph{different subsets} of the dimensions.
\end{itemize}

\framebreak
Often, reported data is destined for an instance of the IIASA Scenario Explorer (like the IPCC AR6 SE).
This means it has to be \structure{\bfseries trasformed to the IAMC data structure}.
\begin{itemize}
  \item This has 6–7 dimensions: \texttt{model-scenario-region-variable-} \texttt{-unit-year}.
  \item \textt{model}, \texttt{scenario} are fixed for a given MESSAGEix Scenario.
  \item We want to specify that:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{region} dimension labels are constructed from \texttt{nl} and/or \texttt{no}.
      \item \texttt{variable}: from some combination of \structure{t-m-c-l},
        plus a name for \emph{emph} is being measured.
      \item \texttt{unit}: consistent with any intermediate operations.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\framebreak
We also want to do \structure{many, similar} such transformations
and then \structure{concatenate} them together.

\bigskip
We want to both \structure{write to file}
\emph{and} \structure{store in an ixmp database} these IAMC-structured data.

\bigskip
We may also want to \structure{produce other output files or data},
tailored to other models/code/tools.

\end{frame}

\column{0.5\paperwidth}
Just as simple to have \emph{dozens} of such effects, calculations, and output files.

\smallskip
One key \py{"transport all"} for MESSAGEix-Transport produces:
\begin{itemize}
  \item ‘Main' IAMC-structured output to CSV and Excel.
  \item 16 PDF documents with multiple pages of plots.
  \item 24 files with intermediate quantities for debugging.
  \item 5 SDMX data flows + structural metadata for some collaborators.

\subsection{Features for developing reporting}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Features for developing reporting}
\vspace*{-2mm}
Reporting is developed iteratively as part of the model-building process.

Besides the describe/visualize features,
\mod{genno} can be used in this process to:

\begin{columns}[T]
\column{0.45\textwidth}
Mix automatic \& custom tasks.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \mod{message_ix} creates a graph with ca. 16,000 possible tasks (\texttt{dask} skips unused ones).
  \item We can add, remove, or replace these using further code.

    E.g. \mod{message_ix_models} adds tasks for modules (transport, buildings, etc.) or projects.
\end{itemize}

Compute intermediate values to debug behaviour

\column{0.45\textwidth}
Integrate with tests via ‘in-line' or ‘pass-through' checks.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Make assertions about the Quantity/data produced
    at a certain point in the graph—then carry on.
  \item E.g. data is produced for expected numbers/lists of nodes or techs.
  \item E.g. data have certain units or dimensionality.
\end{itemize}
\end{columns}
\end{frame}

\section{Model data prep / pre-processing}

\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]
\frametitle{Model data preparation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Example: MESSAGEix-Transport has `demand` parameter values for 5 different passenger modes (2W AIR BUS LDV RAIL) expressed as total passenger-distance travelled (PDT) [kilometre/year] (n, t, y).
  \item Our "standard" configuration uses a certain logic:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item From GDP and population compute GDP per capita (node, year).
      \item From base-year (t=0) PDT values \emph{and} GDP, project future PDT per capita (node, year)
      \item From other input data, compute the **mode share** (node, year, technology) e.g. (n=R12_SAS, y=2060, t=2W) = 0.2 indicating 20\% of all PDT in this (n, y) is by the 2W mode.
      \item Product of (2) and (3) = PDT per capita for each (node, year, technology).
      \item Product of (4) and population = total PDT (n, t, y) = `pdt total:n-t-y` = `demand:n-t-y`
      \item Convert `demand:n-t-y` into a MESSAGE-format `demand` data frame
      \item Add to a target MESSAGE scenario.
    \end{itemize}
  \item But for a certain project, we want to imagine a particular scenario where behavioural changes, digitalization, etc. change how LDVs are used.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Our partners in such a project have produced 2 data files give total LDV **vehicle**-distance travelled and **occupancy** of LDVs, for many countries.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Implementing this with genno is very simple:
we ‘graft' these on to our existing structure of calculations.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Replace `demand:n-t-y` with the concatenation of two quantities:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item `LDV pdt total:n-t-y`
      \item `OTHER pdt total:n-t-y`
    \end{itemize}
  \item `OTHER pdt total:n-t-y` is computed by selecting all n $\in$ (2W AIR BUS RAIL)
    from `pdt total:n-t-y`%
    —this means all of our other steps to compute that quantity are \emph{unchanged}.
  \item `LDV pdt total:n-t-y` (n=LDV) is prepared by a few new steps
    that read, manipulate, aggregate the files provided by our colleagues.
  \item All the rest of our input data prep is \emph{unchanged}.
\end{itemize}

For other projects, we can make different changes to the same or other keys in the task graph.
