\structure{Three challenges} common to other IAMs and models:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Applicable for $\gg 1$ project; \structure{reusable} for many research questions.
  \item Integrates with other models/work conducted by a larger team.
  \item Data is scarce and heterogeneous; preparation is expensive.
\end{enumerate}

\section{MESSAGEix-Transport — goals and structure}

% This frame modified from 2021-12-01 IAMC (Overleaf)
\begin{frame}{What is “MESSAGEix-Transport”?}

A \structure{“variant”} of the MESSAGEix-GLOBIOM (M-G) model \structure{family}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Not an entirely different model or a single model, but a set of modifications made to a ‘base’ M-G model.
  \item Transport systems represented \structure{in greater detail} than base M-G.
  \item Other parts—energy supply, land use, trade, etc.—unmodified.
  \item Evolved from the earlier (ca. 2017) model of \textcite{mccollum-2017}.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Now called “MESSAGE (V)-Transport” to disambiguate.

    “-ix” indicates use of the new MESSAGE\emph{ix} framework.%
    \footnote{\url{https://docs.messageix.org}}
  \end{itemize}
  \item Capable of representing a wide range of current \& future transport modes, technologies, policies, and other phenomena (next slide).
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Levels of abstraction}

\column{0.25\textwidth}
M-T is \structure{less abstracted} than base M-G, but does not model, for instance, components of individual transport vehicles, or individual people.

\bigskip

\end{columns}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Some current applications}
\begin{description}
  \item [NAVIGATE project] Contrast different approaches (shift/reduce activity; electrify; improve technologies) to decarbonize sectors including ‘demand’ (transport, residential) and industry.
  \item [SSP 2024 update] Implement distinct narratives for each of the 5 SSPs, with close calibration to recent (2020 and later) data, and supply parametrization for the M-G base model.
  \item [EDITS project] Investigate a “High [wellbeing] with Low [energy demand] (HwL)” narrative.
  \item [MESSAGEix-IL] Represent consumer preferences w.r.t. different light duty vehicle (LDV) technologies in the single-country MESSAGEix-Israel model.
  \item [NGFS, others] Reflect detailed transport-sector response to economy-wide climate policies.
\end{description}

\end{frame}

\section{Three challenges}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Challenge 1: Many research questions}
These applications entail research questions (RQs) like:
\begin{itemize}
  \item How might behaviour changes affect travel activity and so transport energy use?
  \item Under deep decarbonization, how does transport-sector use of low-carbon energy carriers (electricity, biofuels, synfuels, hydrogen) compete with demands in other sectors?
  \item How different might transport energy use be across the SSPs?
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
Models built from scratch for each of these RQs separately might look very different…but \structure{building new models is expensive} (in time, which $\approx$ money).

\bigskip
We'd rather have \emph{one} tool that is \structure{easily reusable} or extensible for each such application—yet without the less-relevant pieces being too unwieldy.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Challenge 2: Integrate with MESSAGEix-GLOBIOM}

Models in the MESSAGEix-GLOBIOM family have certain features:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Temporal scope (2020–2110) and resolution (5- and 10-year periods).
  \item Spatial scope (global) and resolution (R12 node list; maybe others).
  \item Lists of \texttt{commodity} (energy carriers), \texttt{technology}, etc.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
Available data/knowledge about transport systems may not match these…

\bigskip
…yet we want to \structure{maximize use} of the rich details on energy supply etc. and careful calibration that colleagues have done of base models/scenarios.

\bigskip
Alternate base models for other applications/RQs—like MESSAGEix-IL; MESSAGEix-IN; others—may have different scope and resolution.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Challenge 3: Data}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Few projections for input/techno-economic parameters that cover the temporal scope.

  {\small Example: costs of light duty vehicles (LDVs) and their components (especially: batteries)—projections rarely go beyond 20 years.}

  \item Data quality (by many criteria) varies widely across the spatial scope.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
Suppose we choose sophisticated method ‘M’ developed using data for geography ‘G1’ (wealthy country with a well-funded statistical agency).

\bigskip
We may find that data is not available for geography ‘G2’ (many low-income countries/regions).
Then we are cornered: we must find, assume, or construct (make up) data for G2.

This is costly, and model results may reflect little besides our assumptions.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Two strategies}

\large

\begin{description}
  \item [Modularity] Break down methods for handling input data and preparing model data to atomic steps.

  → Allows to respond differently to data limitations in different parts of the transport system/existing sources.
  \item [Repeatable workflows] including tools (an “easy button” to build and solve the model) and practices (push the button often).

  → Allows to flexibly accommodate and update different applications.
\end{description}

\medskip
\hspace{15mm} Let's look at each in detail.
\end{frame}

\section{1: Modularity}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Modularity}

Break methods (algorithms, steps, processes) down into \structure{atomic steps}.

\bigskip
That includes methods for:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Handling \structure{input data}—read files, clean, adjust, (dis)aggregate, harmonize, fill, extrapolate, etc.
  \item \structure{Implementing settings or assumptions} for specific scenarios or configuration (e.g. R12 nodes vs. ISR nodes).
  \item Making \structure{exogenous projections}.
  \item Preparing the parameter data used by the core MESSAGE\emph{ix} implementation.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
Imagine these as a graph (tree, network) of nodes and edges.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Calculations as a graph}
\begin{columns}[T]
\column{0.48\textwidth}
Example 1:

\bigskip
{\LARGE $A + B = C$}

\bigskip
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{genno-ABC.pdf}

\column{0.48\textwidth}
Example 2:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Load projected GDP for SSP4.
  \item Load projected population.
  \item Compute the ratio of (1) and (2).
  \item Compute index of (3) versus the base-year.
  \item Load historical data on passenger-distance travelled (PDT) per capita.
  \item Project future PDT per capita as a function of (4), (5)
  \item […] (further steps)
\end{enumerate}
\end{columns}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Why do this?}
Instead of “a script” or “a notebook” of 100s or 1000s of lines of code, each \structure{operation} can be described by a simple, short function.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Easily documented, read, and understood.
  \item Easily tested.
  \item Instead of duplicating code, reuse the operator with different inputs.
\end{itemize}

\medskip
Implemented using \texttt{genno}, based on \texttt{dask}.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Same framework developed for ‘reporting’ in \texttt{message\_ix} \& co.
  \item Tracks chains of calculations, arbitrarily long.
  \item Same functions/methods can be used \structure{regardless of dimensions, resolution, and units}.
  \item Easy to \structure{graft} different trees on to the graph to swap out methods.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Dimension \& resolution agnostic}
Suppose: $A + B = C_{xyz} = [ c_{xyz} ], \quad c_{xyz} \in \mathbb{R} \, \forall \, x, y, z$

\bigskip
\structure{Dimensionality.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Suppose $A_{xyz} = [ a_{xyz} ]$, a 3-dimensional quantity.
  \item If we choose (say, early in model-building), $B$ can be a scalar $b$.
  \item Later on, we can choose (if we have data, or time to construct detailed assumptions based on a scenario narrative) that $B$ has dimensions like $\{x, z\}$: $B_{xz} = [ b_{xz} ]$.
  \item \structure{Either way}, the code will align with $A$ to produce $C_{xyz}$ with the desired dimensions, with \structure{no adjustment required}.
  \item Further calculations on $C$ are independent of whether $B$ was scalar or a matrix.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Dimension \& resolution agnostic}
Suppose: $A + B = C_{xyz} = [ c_{xyz} ], \quad c_{xyz} \in \mathbb{R} \, \forall \, x, y, z$

\bigskip
\structure{Resolution.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Suppose we change the labels on dimension $z$.

  For example: $z$ might be the MESSAGEix ‘node’ or ‘year’ dimension.
  \item The methods (code, operators) need \structure{no adjustment}—so long as there is consistency with the rest of the input data (like $A_{xyz}$).
  \item We can also automate steps to transform data to ensure this consistency: for instance, aggregate country-resolution GDP/capita from certain source labels to R12, R14, or to a different target list.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{‘Graft’ on new methods}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item [Ex. 1] MESSAGEix-IL-Transport: \structure{replace} the calculation method for ‘disutility’ (fixed behavioural factor affecting technology choice for LDVs) from base M-T

  \structure{…with} data computed from files specific to MESSAGEix-IL. (See following talk by A. Davidovitch.)
  \item [Ex. 2] ‘Demand’ logic: \structure{replace} top-down calculation (per Schaeffer et al. 2010) of PDT per capita, the total, and the values for each transport mode

  \structure{…with} a bottom-up calculation based on trip rates, distances, etc.
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip
Requires only to tell \texttt{genno} that, for instance, “intermediate quantity \texttt{<pdt:n-t-y:total>} is given by running \emph{this} atomic function on \emph{these} inputs.”
Flow of data in to and out of this step is automatically adjusted.
\end{frame}

\section{2: Reproducible workflows}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Reproducible workflows}

Nearly every workflow for \structure{model-based research} can be broken down into the following steps:

\bigskip
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Identify \structure{what is to be represented} and desired representation.
  \item Identify a \structure{base scenario}: empty, or with some data from prior work.
  \item \structure{Build} the target scenario from the base scenario.

  May include running entire other models (“soft-linking”).
  \item \structure{Solve} the built scenario.
  \item \structure{Report} the scenario: any N-dimensional quantities, plots, or other outputs.
  \item Inspect the direct (4) and reporting (5) outputs for validity, according to some criteria.
  \item Cycle back to (1).
\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Data flow in steps (3–5)}
  \hspace*{-10mm}\includegraphics[width=\paperwidth]{data-stages.pdf}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Reproducible workflows}
\framesubtitle{Some observations (1 of 2)}

\begin{columns}[T]
\column{0.2\textwidth}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \structure{Design}.
  \item \structure{Base scenario}.
  \item \structure{Build}.
  \item \structure{Solve}.
  \item \structure{Report}.
  \item \structure{Validate}.
  \item Cycle.
\end{enumerate}

\column{0.8\textwidth}
\begin{itemize}
  \item All of these \emph{may} be done manually, but automation can help greatly.
  \item Manual steps may not be repeatable w/o clear documentation.
  \item Cost of manual steps scales if $\geq 2$ scenarios are run.
  \item (4) might be skipped—\emph{ex ante} vs. \emph{ex post} validation.
  \item Criteria (6) often vary greatly according to the intended application/RQs.
  \item Shorter cycle time → more cycles → more refined outcomes and methods (e.g. sensitivity analyses) possible.
  \item (3–5) may have sub-steps.
\end{itemize}

\end{columns}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Reproducible workflows}
\framesubtitle{Further observations (2 of 2)}

\begin{columns}[T]
\column{0.2\textwidth}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \structure{Design}.
  \item \structure{Base scenario}.
  \item \structure{Build}.
  \item \structure{Solve}.
  \item \structure{Report}.
  \item \structure{Validate}.
  \item Cycle.
\end{enumerate}

\column{0.8\textwidth}
Often we want to \structure{chain}, \structure{nest}, or \structure{merge} workflows.

\smallskip
Ex. 1: combine ‘build’ substeps from MESSAGEix-Transport and a workflow that sets up a specific (but generic) climate policy.

\smallskip
Ex. 2: combine ‘build’ substeps from the MESSAGEix-Transport, -Buildings, and -Materials workflows to produce a "B-M-T" target scenario.

\smallskip
Ex. 3: combine ‘report’ substeps for MESSAGEix-Transport and the base M-G model.

\smallskip
Ex. 4: ‘build’ the policy parametrization of one scenario based on the ‘solved’ or ‘reported’ outcome of another.
\end{columns}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Repeatable → reproducible}

Again use the concepts of a chain of nodes (scenarios) and edges (workflow steps)—this time, at a higher level of abstraction.

\bigskip
Tooling: implemented in the \texttt{message-ix-models} Python package.

See docs on \href{https://docs.messageix.org/projects/models/en/latest/api/workflow.html}{“Multi-scenario workflows”}.

\bigskip
Define atomic workflow steps → compose workflows using these.

\bigskip
Provide a \structure{command-line interface} to run entire workflows or portions; other tools to visualize, log, diagnose.
\end{frame}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Steps with function names (tied to implementation in Python code).

  Build an “easy button” and press it often.
\end{quote}

\bigskip
Growing collection of atomic workflow steps \emph{and} composed full workflows for NAVIGATE, NGFS, MESSAGEix-IL, SSP, and other projects.

\bigskip
Fully-automated/hands-free end-to-end “continuous integration” on daily schedule/other triggers, using GitHub and the same CLI tool and commands used manually.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Build- and report-stage data files, plots, etc. generated on incremental changes to model input data and assumptions.
  \item Enables rapid feedback and efficient use of researchers' time.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\section*{Wrap-up}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Tools + examples for other modelers}

Current activity: SSP 2024 implementation → parameter data for base M-G.

(See following talk by A. Javaid.)

\bigskip
Following immediately: release of \texttt{message\_ix\_models.model.transport}

—a module in the public MESSAGEix modeling tools repository.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Parallel to \texttt{.water}, \texttt{.material} and others, and using the same processes.
  \item Complete documentation \& test suite, and model description paper.
  \item Data prepped for R12 nodes, with clear declaration of data needs for application to other geographies.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
In the meanwhile, \structure{please reach out}—we are happy to help others apply the same strategies in their modeling workflows and reap the same benefits.

% \begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]
%   \frametitle{LP techniques for demand-side sectors}

%   \bigskip
%   Original/natural mapping of the MESSAGEix \texttt{commodity}, and \texttt{technology} concepts:
%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item A measurable quantity of a physical object, e.g. \texttt{coal}.
%     \item A artifact/machine that performs a physical process, e.g. \texttt{coal\_ppl}.
%   \end{itemize}

%   \bigskip
%   \emph{Energy services} are often conceived as intangible (“health”, “access”), socio-cultural concepts measured as constructed quantities (“disability-adjusted life-year (DALY)” vs. “kg of coal”).

%   \framebreak
%   \structure{“Pseudo”}-technologies and commodities.
%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item Represent a quantity that is \emph{measurable} but perhaps not \emph{physical} as a “\texttt{commodity}”.
%     \item Express MESSAGEix \texttt{demand} in these commodities.
%     \item Represent a socio-technical process or relationship between two commodities (in the above sense) as a “\texttt{technology}”.
%   \end{itemize}

%   \bigskip
%   MESSAGEix-Transport example:
%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item Transport activity various measures (distance traveled by a vehicle; distance traveled by a person; trips) → \texttt{commodity}
%     \item “Usage” and “occupancy” of vehicles by people to obtain the energy service of passenger-distance traveled → \texttt{technology}.
%   \end{itemize}

% \end{frame}

% \subsection{Systems theory for global modeling}

% \begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]
%   \frametitle{Systems theory for global modeling}

%   In general, IAMs are always dependent on data and other models that treat the real-world phenomena in much greater detail, with domain-specific theory \& methods.

%   \bigskip
%   For example, in transport:
%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item Short-distance passenger: agent-based microsimulation of daily activity particular cities or model cities.
%     \item Interaction of land-use, built environment, and mobility: “ILUTE”.
%     \item Choice of vehicle technology or new modes (sharing, etc.):
%     \item Aviation: models of airport expansion, new aircraft technologies.
%     \item International freight: gravity models connecting ports.
%   \end{itemize}

%   \bigskip
%   How do we preserve the information/validity of these while connecting or emulating them in IAMs?

%   \bigskip
%   → Recall and apply engineering systems theory.
