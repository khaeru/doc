\begin{frame}{Internal vs.\ external validity}
\framesubtitle{Concerns for scientific modeling \& scenario research}

\structure{Internal validity.} Research is free of errors:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Correctly implements theory w/o conceptual errors.
  \item Confounding variables addressed to identify relationships between independent and dependent variables.
  \item Alternative hypotheses can be rejected.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
\structure{External validity.} Research is generalizable to other conditions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Research can be replicated or reproduced in a different context.
  \item Research is robust to differences between the study context and other contexts to which conclusions are applied.
  \item Research is robust to plausible alternatives to key assumptions.
\end{itemize}
