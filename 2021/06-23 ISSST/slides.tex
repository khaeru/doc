\maketitle

\note{
Good day everyone, and thank you for joining for this talk on “effective strategies for multi-sectoral research using large-scale models”.

My name is Paul Kishimoto, and I am a research scholar in the ECE program at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis.

\note{
This is a bit of an odd talk, because I'm going to jump from a high-level, conceptual, or meta perspective on model-based research, straight down to quotidian activities that we don't usually talk about when we present results.

In fact I'm not going to promote any particular study, but instead discuss \emph{how} we do research with models, and suggest some ways to improve that.

My hope, by the time I finish, is that you will also see the importance of these perspectives, and try applying them in your own work.

\section{Motivation and concepts}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Motivation}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Pursuit of climate change mitigation and other SDGs entails \structure{changes in systems}—complex, large, interconnected, open, sociotechnical.%
  \footcite[or “CLIOS”, per]{mostashari-sussman-2009}
  \item Quantitative computer models%
  \footnote{aka. analyses, workflows, tools, scripts.}
  are used to study these systems.
  \item Change challenge boundaries between ‘sectors’ of human/economic activity:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Changes large enough that feedbacks from other sectors are non-negligible.
      \item New technologies establish new interactions, e.g. electric vehicle–grid interoperation.
    \end{itemize}
  \item We are motivated to \structure{connect sets (N≥2) of models} or \structure{increase complexity} to study changes in multiple subsystems at once.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\note{
These sectoral boundaries have, of course, also become disciplinary boundaries.

\subsection{Validity, reproducibility, interoperability, reuse}
\begin{frame}{Validity and reproducibility}

Since the model is not the real world, implications drawn from modeling results must be externally valid.
Specific threats, as forms of uncertainty:

\begin{description}
  \item [Structural.] Is the theory a correct description of the phenomena?

    → Responses: alternate model formulations.

  \item [Measurement] uncertainty of input data and parameters.

    → Sensitivity analyses, large ($>10^3$) ensembles of model runs.

  \item [Epistemic] uncertainty in conditions (e.g. future policy) that are unknowable, or whereof uncertainty cannot be quantified.

    → Alternate scenarios.
\end{description}

All require a \structure{quality} instrument that can be \structure{reused in an easy, automated manner}, giving the \structure{same results every time}—a \structure{\bfseries reproducible} model.
\end{frame}

}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{“… Interoperable \& Reusable”}

Are these true \emph{in principle} or \emph{in practice}?
\begin{itemize}
  \item Easy to claim that others \structure{could, in principle}, re-use elements of a model-based research workflow.
  \item Much harder: make this an \structure{actual practice}, i.e. feasible with resources possessed by ≥1 other.
\end{itemize}

\medskip
Even achievable reproduction is not true reusability.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \structure{Equity \& inclusion} require that analytical tools and capabilities be broadly distributed.
  \item Not adequate that researchers from LMICs join well-resourced incumbent modeling teams, if these remain central.
  \item Urgency of climate change \& SDGs requires we bring more hands to the work.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\note{
The key question to ask is always: has someone actually managed to reuse this tool?
Has someone made it interoperate with another?

The goal of equity sets an even higher bar.
I won't go on about this; I'll only say: If someone can or does reuse my tools, but I always have to be involved in that to support them, and be compensated in some way for that work, then I centre myself and I limit the work that can be done to the number of people that I or my group can support.
}

\subsection{Costs, resources}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Costs \& resources}

We have finite resources (time etc.) with which to conduct research.
Model creation \& use work should spend those resources efficiently.

\smallskip
\structure{Search \& information}
\begin{itemize}
  \item How do I run the model? What does this line of code do?
  \item What about student S, who did … 2 years ago—where is that?
  \item What version of the model produced results for this 1 y/o manuscript?
\end{itemize}

\structure{Quality control \& enforcement}
\begin{itemize}
  \item When/why did our reference forecast shift in region $r$ \& sector $g$?
  \item Who broke the model so Policy Z no longer has a feasible solution?
\end{itemize}

\structure{Recovery/disruption}
\begin{itemize}
  \item If colleague C left tomorrow, could we continue our work?%
  \footnote{aka. the \emph{bus factor} or \emph{truck number}.}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\bigskip
Caveats:
\begin{itemize}
  \item We aren't perfectly ‘OFAIR’ yet. This talk = mix of status \& goals.
  \item We celebrate continual improvement \& efforts of others to improve.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Strategy and practice for modeling}

Start with organizational culture:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Discuss and identify in your team where resources are exhausted.
  \item Study possible improvements in practice.
  \item Agree that there is a positive return on investment.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
A collection of interlinked and mutually-reinforcing practices.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Can be adopted separately, incrementally.
  \item Also a collection of skills → support skills development in your team.
  \item “A truly remarkable variety of practices, but these slides are too few to contain them.”
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[plain]

\subsection{Use version control; write documentation}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The basics: version control, docs}

Use version control.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \url{https://github.com/iiasa/message_ix}
  \item Use fewer, larger, better-organized repositories.
  \item Learn and use the GitHub workflow.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
Write (and read) documentation.
\begin{itemize}
  \item The \#1 audience for this is \emph{you}, or your closest collaborators.
  \item Rubber duck \& pair program: explain to a duck what the code does.
  \item Use services like Read The Docs: automate build \& publish steps for every change to the code.%
  \footnote{\href{https://readthedocs.com/projects/iiasa-energy-program-message-ix/}{readthedocs.com/projects/iiasa-energy-program-message-ix/}}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\subsection{Write modular code for reuse}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Write modular code for reuse}

Common to have a variety of tasks in one (very long) “script” (or a few):
\begin{itemize}
  \item Input data processing, assumptions, bits of methods adopted from literature, core methods/workflow, post-processing/plotting, output, logging…
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
Instead, and \structure{from the start}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Separate concerns: 1 task per code object; files group related tasks.
  \item DRY: don't repeat yourself. Write \& reuse functions and classes → fewer occasions for error.
  \item Smaller, atomic functions \& classes are easier to document, understand, and validate.%
    \footnote{Often can be replaced entirely with high-quality, performant ones\\ \hspace{40mm} from popular libraries; read the docs!}
  \item New data, methods, etc. can be easily swapped-in.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\subsection{Write tests (=internal validity)}
\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Write tests for internal validity}

Software tests = code that runs other code, giving a “pass” or “fail” result.

\smallskip
\begin{minted}{python}
def test_stock(dummy_data):
    observed = compute_vehicle_stock(dummy_data)
    expected = 42.1
    assert observed == expected
\end{minted}

\smallskip
Code that implements core theory/methods can be tested for a variety of inputs $\equiv$ checks of internal validity.

\medskip
MESSAGE\emph{ix}: 100s of tests from basic (data I/O) to complex functionality (LP constraint relaxation; dynamic penetration of new technologies…)

→ \href{https://github.com/iiasa/message_ix/tree/main/message_ix/tests}{github.com/iiasa/message\_ix/tree/main/message\_ix/tests}

\end{frame}

\subsection{Automate, towards “continuous reproduction”}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Automate}
\framesubtitle{towards “continuous reproduction”}

\structure{Continuous integration} (CI) services:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Watch a code repository, e.g. on GitHub, for changes.
  \item Automatically grab new versions.
  \item Perform certain actions, e.g. run a suite of tests.
\end{itemize}

\medskip
When tests cover \emph{all core methods} in a model, then CI reduces work to guard against \structure{invalidity} when improving models (‘reggressions’).

\medskip
When code includes \emph{all the steps} in a model-based analysis, the CI system can \structure{continuous confirm reproducibility}.

Example: A \href{https://github.com/iiasa/message_ix/blob/main/tutorial/westeros/westeros_baseline.ipynb}{tutorial notebook} from MESSAGE\emph{ix}.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Constructs and solves a simple energy system model.
  \item Full-scale models currently private (proprietary data).
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\end{frame}

\subsection{Separate model-building components}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Separate model-building components}

Separate code that prepares a “base” model from code that adds detail \& resolution related to a particular phenomenon or sector.

\bigskip
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \node (m-g) {Global};
  \piece[IIASAblue]{m-g}

  \only<1-2>{
  \node [anchor=west] at ($(m-g.east) + (1, 0)$)

  }

  \node (m-t) at (m-t-pos) {Transport};
  \piece[IIASAgreen]{m-t}
\end{tikzpicture}

\column{0.6\paperwidth}
Each of these pieces is under continual development by separate teams of researchers.
This \emph{could} entail frequent and laborious adjustments.

\bigskip
\pause Modularity + testing ensure that the “shape of the piece” (structure and data of the model prepared by some code) is stable.

\smallskip
\pause → base “Global” model presents the same shape.

\pause → code that configures the “Transport” variant works on anything that has this shape.
\end{columns}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Separate model-building components}

Pieces can “be plugged in” to any base or enhanced model, so long as it presents the right shape $\equiv$ valid models can be composed with details required for particular studies.

\subsection{Be precise about metrology; use “data interfaces”}
\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]
\frametitle{Use precise metrology}

Specify data flows separately from methods:
\smallskip

\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{data-stages}

These form another kind of \structure{interface} and help towards \structure{interoperability}.

\framebreak

At each stage, (1) through (4), be precise about:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Background vs. systematized concepts vs. specific measures.\footcite{adcock-collier-2001}
  \item Dimensions, and the specific codes%
    \footnote{e.g. \texttt{Canada} vs. \texttt{CAN} vs. \texttt{CA}; \href{https://paul.kishimoto.name/2021/01/handling-country-codes/}{read more}.}
    used along each.
  \item Units of measurement. (Check with \href{https://pint.readthedocs.io}{Pint} or similar.)
\end{itemize}

\medskip
Treat all assumptions as input data → none in code.

\medskip
Don't invent new data formats for exchange.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Reuse existing formats and protocols for exchange

    e.g. SDMX (\href{https://sdmx.org}{1}, \href{https://sdmx1.readthedocs.io/en/latest}{2}), \href{https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/}{NetCDF}, \href{https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/}{Zarr}, etc., .
  \item Reuse existing (or shared) codes and labels

    e.g. \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes}{ISO 3166-1}; \href{https://registry.sdmx.org/items/codelist.html}{SDMX global registry}.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\section{Conclusions}
\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]
\frametitle{Conclusion: back to costs}
Not mentioned earlier: cost of disobeying incentives.

\bigskip
Some incentives that can affect us as model-builders and -users:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Publish; only work that can be claimed ‘novel’, and only when final.
  \item Signal compliance with disciplinary norms with minimal effort.
  \item Assist only collaborators / co-authors.
  \item Undervalue process.
  \item Don't budget for maintenance and support.
  \item ‘Impressive’ polish, GUIs, and ease of rudimentary use over ‘mundane’ validation and tools for advanced use.
\end{itemize}

\framebreak
In contrast, free software—thus also \structure{open science}—succeeds when:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Communities work together to build a smaller number of higher-quality projects that are public goods.
  \item Innovation is planned \& done out in the open.
  \item Support, documentation, and enabling others' contributions is first-class, valued work.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
→ not the same activities, shared \emph{ex post}; but a dramatic change in norms.
